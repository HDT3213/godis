`Godis` is a golang implementation of Redis Server, which intents to provide an example of writing a high concurrent
middleware using golang.

Key Features:

- Support string, list, hash, set, sorted set
- Multi Database and `SELECT` command  
- TTL
- Publish/Subscribe
- GEO
- AOF and AOF Rewrite
- MULTI Commands Transaction is Atomic and Isolated. If any errors are encountered during execution, godis will rollback the executed commands
- Server-side Cluster which is transparent to client. You can connect to any node in the cluster to
  access all data in the cluster.
  - `MSET`, `DEL` command is supported and atomically executed in cluster mode
  - `Rename`, `RenameNX` command is supported within slot in cluster mode
  - MULTI Commands Transaction is supported within slot in cluster mode
- Concurrent Core, so you don't have to worry about your commands blocking the server too much. 

If you could read Chinese, you can find more details in [My Blog](https://www.cnblogs.com/Finley/category/1598973.html).

## Get Started

You can get runnable program in the releases of this repository, which supports Linux and Darwin system.

```bash
./godis-darwin
./godis-linux
```

![](https://i.loli.net/2021/05/15/oQM1yZ6pWm3AIEj.png)

You could use redis-cli or other redis client to connect godis server, which listens on 0.0.0.0:6399 on default mode.

![](https://i.loli.net/2021/05/15/7WquEgonzY62sZI.png)

The program will try to read config file path from environment variable `CONFIG`.

If environment variable is not set, then the program try to read `redis.conf` in the working directory.

If there is no such file, then the program will run with default config.

### cluster mode

Godis can work in cluster mode, please append following lines to redis.conf file

```ini
peers localhost:7379,localhost:7389 // other node in cluster
self  localhost:6399 // self address
```

We provide node1.conf and node2.conf for demonstration. use following command line to start a two-node-cluster:

```bash
CONFIG=node1.conf ./godis-darwin &
CONFIG=node2.conf ./godis-darwin &
``` 

Connect to a node in the cluster to access all data in the cluster:

```cmd
redis-cli -p 6399
```

## Read My Code

If you want to read my code in this repository, here is a simple guidance.

- project root: only the entry point
- config: config parser
- interface: some interface definitions
- lib: some utils, such as logger, sync utils and wildcard

I suggest focusing on the following directories:

- tcp: the tcp server
- redis: the redis protocol parser
- datastruct: the implements of data structures
    - dict: a concurrent hash map
    - list: a linked list
    - lock: it is used to lock keys to ensure thread safety
    - set: a hash set based on map
    - sortedset: a sorted set implements based on skiplist
- database: the core of storage engine
    - server.go: a standalone redis server, 
    - db.go: the basement function of database
    - exec.go: the gateway of database
    - router.go: the command table
    - keys.go: handlers for keys commands
    - string.go: handlers for string commands
    - list.go: handlers for list commands
    - hash.go: handlers for hash commands
    - set.go: handlers for set commands
    - sortedset.go: handlers for sorted set commands
    - pubsub.go: implements of publish / subscribe
    - aof.go: implements of AOF persistence and rewrite
    - geo.go: implements of geography features
    - sys.go: authentication and other system function
    - transaction.go: local transaction
- cluster: 
    - cluster.go: entrance of cluster mode
    - com.go: communication within nodes
    - del.go: atomic implementation of `delete` command in cluster
    - keys.go: keys command
    - mset.go: atomic implementation of `mset` command in cluster
    - multi.go: entrance of distributed transaction
    - pubsub.go: pub/sub in cluster
    - rename.go: `rename` command in cluster 
    - tcc.go: try-commit-catch distributed transaction implementation
- aof: AOF persistence
